# Reproducing YAGO3-10 Dataset

This guide provides instructions on how to reproduce the YAGO3-10 dataset using the provided model and scripts.

## Steps to Reproduce

### 1. Clone the Dataset

First, clone the dataset repository from the following link:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/KnowledgeGraphEmbedding.git
2. Replace model.py
Next, replace the model.py file in the cloned repository with the model.py file provided in the supplementary materials.

3. Run the Training Script
To run the training script, use the following command:

bash
复制代码
bash run.sh train MODE YAGO3-10 0 0 1024 400 480 24.0 1.0 0.0002 200000 4
This will start the training process for the MODE model on the YAGO3-10 dataset.

Additional Information
